# Configuration file for "scour" utility, to delete all files older than a
# specified number of days from specified directories and all their
# subdirectories.  Scour should be invoked periodically by cron(8).
#
# Each line consists of a directory, a retention time (in days), and
# (optionally) a shell filename pattern for files to be deleted.  If no
# filename pattern is specified, "*" representing all files not beginning with
# "." is assumed.  The syntax "~user" is understood.  Non-absolute pathnames
# are relative to the directory `regutil /pqact/datadir-path`.
#
# A hash in column one indicates a comment line.
